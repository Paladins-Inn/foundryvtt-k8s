== Context
The {gloss_scs} produces HTML for the web application.
The HTML is needed for the controlled pages and for the {gloss_transclude}s.


== Decision
While there are very good reasons to use <<thymeleaf>> or <<freemarker>> as templating engines, I decided to use <<jte_java_template_engine>>.
It is an easy to use, modern templating engine that is specifically designed for Java applications.
But more importantly: I want to get used to it, since it is used at my place of work.


== Consequences
. Templates have to be written in JTE syntax.
. The templates are not HTML compliant, so they cannot be used as static HTML files.


== Decision Drivers
